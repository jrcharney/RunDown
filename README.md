# RunDown

**RunDown** is a theme based on Robb Owen's [Synthwave '84](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode).  RunDown is a dark theme.

By default, I don't use the Fira font. I'm more of a [Hack Font](https://sourcefoundry.org/hack/) person.

## TODO
- [ ] **[Github Flavored MarkDown](https://help.github.com/en/categories/writing-on-github).** Everybody seems to likes it so why not. [Have a cheetsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) while you are here. ;-)
- [ ] **Glowing text option.** Robb said he was having some issue with the glowing text in VS Code. So just to be safe, the MarkDown editors will be treated similarly. Off by default.
- [ ] **[Fira font](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) option.** I don't use this, but I'll include it anyway. If you don't have this fon't I suggest getting the patched version from [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/).
- [ ] **[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) theme support.** [Zettlr](https://zettlr.com/) uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). I assume [Typora](https://www.typora.io/) follows the same rules. 
- [ ] **[UML](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/)/[BPMN](http://www.bpmn.org/) Diagram theme support.** One of the things that I really like about Typora is its support for [Flowchart.js](http://flowchart.js.org/) or [Mermaid.js](https://mermaidjs.github.io/). I was under the assumption that this was based on [Graphviz Dot](https://www.graphviz.org/documentation/) but I think I'm wrong. Hopefully it supports [Entity-Relationship Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model) and [Class Diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram).
- [ ] **Sprinkle in some [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) and [SemVer](https://semver.org/)**.
- [ ] **What's better? [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) or [JSON](https://www.json.org/)?** (It's probably not relevant to this project, I just needed to stick this question somewhere.)
- [ ] **Add more "a e s t h e t i c" to this page.** The *RoboCop* font for the logo was a good start, but needs more color. Spend some time working on the art.
